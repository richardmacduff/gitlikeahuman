# Git Like A Human
A book on Git for non-programmers by Walter vannini

## Rationale

Git is a spectacular piece of software for keeping track of changes, creative explorations of new paths. In a nutshell, all that makes up creative but also highly disciplined work, as software work is.

Unfortunately, git documentation is written by, and meant for, programmers. This means that jargon rules, workflow is taken for granted and things get unnecessarily obscure.

By this I mean that even I, a 30-year IT veteran but not a professional programmer, am routinely dumbfounded as to **what I should do with git for git to do what I want**, even I have a very clear notion of what I want to do.

Git is not a simple software to use, and that is ok, because  keeping track of changes and decisions is no simple task. But much of the complication is unnecessary.

With this effort, I hope to render git's abilities clear enough so that writers will be able to see how helpful git is.
